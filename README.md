ECHO Caves is A browser extension that brings a dark mode to the New Tech Network (NTN) ECHO portal powered by Agilix Buzz. It was Developed by Reactive Peak Studios as a senior project for High School.

### Proposal

I know a lot of people are having trouble focusing at home, especially when they may have to stare at a screen for 6+ hours per day! I awoke one morning and I had this really strange wish that ECHO had some sort of dark mode / night light mode so I could focus on what mattered most, my education. It came to my realization that Agilix - the developers of our beloved portal - was much bigger than I originally thought. My first instinct was to bring it up with the school or district, but just then I had a million dollar idea pop up into my head. I realized that if I wanted to make a successful career out of software development / programming in general, I'd have to showcase some of my own projects. This would be my first project I've ever made "public" (it is accessible to anyone who has an ECHO account / link access). I decided to call for more help since this would be a long journey alone and I'd like to have someone develop alongside me. I couldn't have chosen a better partner than Naysen Antonio, someone who I know I could trust and really bring the ideas to life. We're both extremely excited to showcase ECHO Caves, a dark mode and custom theme loader for ECHO!

### Overview
[![N|Solid](https://github.com/ReactivePeakStudios/ECHO-Caves/blob/main/Development/ECimages/EC-Screenshot_1.jpg)
Echo caves a browser extension. It is a dark theme for echo with extra features to load your own customized theme! It was designed with one specific thing in mind - to increase productivity and ensure that the ability to focus on work was much easier. As the extension was coming together, ECHO Caves became much more than that. Not only does it conserve battery usage, it also allows students to be creative. With Themepunk (the ECHO Caves theme-builder) students are able to create their own theme and submit their theme straight into the extension's graphical user interface. From there, they will be able to reload the page and - just like that - their theme has been loaded and will be used each time they login. 

There has been a rough concept brought up between naysen and I to build a community page where students are able to share their themes with other students. This, of course, is not an easy task and will require multiple weeks and possibly even months to develop. it is still really fresh but we’re both considering it.

### Purpose

This project was designed with productivity in mind; ensuring that the ability to focus on work was much easier. We’ve both had an incredible time developing this extension and, honestly, I’m proud of what we had been able to accomplish in such a short period of time (we started around October and the first alpha was released November 24th on the Chrome Store). We both thought this would also be a perfect way to showcase what we are capable of developing. This is also a great project to put on our resume / portfolio. Because of all this, we thought it would be the perfect project for our senior defense.	

### Use

The extension is available on the Chrome Store! It’s unlisted so you’ll have to access it through this global link since it keeps it within our district. (This still doesn’t restrict outsiders from downloading it but they wouldn’t have much use since they need an ECHO account to make use of it.)

### If I download this extension, 
- ##### Are you able to access my ECHO account?
- ##### Can you see my grades?
- ##### Will my data be shared with anyone?
Absolutely not. This extension doesn’t scrape any user data and is run locally (no scripts are located outside of what’s running in the extension itself) We take privacy very seriously and I can’t stress that enough. (I’m unsure if this requires me to have a privacy policy at all since it is not shared between scripts, just in the users local cache. If it is the case that I need one then I will write one).

### Am I able to fork this project for myself? 
As of now, this project is closed source. However, this still means that it is completely free to use, just not free to expand unless we move from our current license (Apache-2.0) to an open source license (GPL, MIT, etc.)

### What license is this project under? May I read more about this?
The project is under the Apache-2.0 license and of course you can!
